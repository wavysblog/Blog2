WOO OUR FIRST INTERVIEW

Well, have you all ever been bored at school? Well FoxMoss is someone trying to fix that. [Their website](fishme.me) is awesome and disguised as a news website. Pretty much, there's a certain article that you go to and press one of the things in the first paragraph (;

Soooooo, here goes nothing!

Me: Hello! Could I get in contact with you for an interview? I really admire your unblocked games website but have some questions, like for example what is https://proxy.mediaology.com/ ? Anyways if you can that's awesome, not gonna nag you about it, thanks!
(also I don't use voice, so id prefer if this interview was done over dms)

FoxMoss: honestly im not sure what that is
yeah i can answer any of your questions

Me: alr, thanks

Me: okay, first of all, why does your website show up as a unblocker?
everywhere i go 
did you used to have a proxy/unblocker

FoxMoss: i do and i still do youll just have to find it ;) 

Me: im always up for a challenge ðŸ™‚
anyways, second, did any website inspire you to make this? or is this just a random idea you thought up

FoxMoss: i first wanted to share my games, then started hosting other peoples games. i didnt really intend to make an unblocked games site but i now see it as a good kicking off platform for other projects

Me: nice!
oh wait, i was going to ask if you heard about the bookmarklet ban but apparently youre on the cc lol
[the link](https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/chromium/src/+/4558108)

FoxMoss: it really sucks since i had a project (still in beta https://foxmoss.com/foxlauncher/ feel free to message me for help )  
that needed bookmarks for some of the cooler features

Me: oh thats sad, ill try to see if any bypasses are there, bc in the words of 3hko, chromebooks are terrible garbage excuses for computers

FoxMoss: i try to stay up to date with exploits, ive found some myself nothing large

Me: nice!
how do you feel about google sites unblocked games websites?

FoxMoss: theyre fine ig
lacking in creativity

Me: yeah, my school just finished their 14,591st block, and every other game website was blocked, and then, they blocked google sites
where did you get the idea to start the foss news area from

FoxMoss: i have a friend evelyn who pitches a bunch of ideas to me. who pitched turning what at the time was a pretty daft calculator into a news site. i was getting tired of people nicking my calculator code and not crediting me so i wanted to make something harder to steal.

Me: ah, i see, thats pretty cool
also, question, can you please put run 2 on the unblocked games portion?

FoxMoss: i dont think ruffle(flash emulator) supports it

Me: it doesm't, but waflash does ([link](https://shadowgmes.github.io/gfiles/run2/))

FoxMoss: ill look into it

Me: alr, how do you host fossnews and all those other things

FoxMoss: https://buyvm.net/ $4 a month, they have great customer service

Me: ill look into that, im currently hosting my proxies on koyeb
well,  i think thats all i need except do you consent to me using this interview in a video with links to ur site and is their anything you'd like me to credit?
oh shoot i have to go

FoxMoss: totally, send me the video when your done

Me: alr, wd
have a nice day/evening/whatever time it is in whatever timezone your in

FoxMoss: all of them at once

Me: lol
